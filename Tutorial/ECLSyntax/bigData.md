# Big Data
Big data refers to a large amount of data that is hard to be processed and managed using traditional data management systems.  

Big data is defined by three common properties called 3Vs: volume, variety and velocity. While there are other Vs involved such as Value and Veracity, the 3Vs are the most famous ones. 

__Velocity__ 
It's the measurement of how fast data is coming into the system, it's processed and it's transferred to desire destination. The higher the velocity rate, the faster data is processed.

__Variety__
Variety refers to different type of data b

__Volume__
Volume is the size of the dataset. Larger datasets could require different processes or infrastructure.
